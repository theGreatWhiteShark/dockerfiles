An **Ubuntu16.04** system with **Pandoc** and a compiled
version of **R-3.4.0**

### 1.1.1

Like 1.1.0 but also installs the *unzip* package. This one is required
for `devtools::install_github()` inside R (in the current CRAN
release) to extract zip images. 

### 1.1.0

This image depends on **Pandoc 1.17.2**. 

The **R-3.4.0** version was compiled from source and a number of
system packages have been installed to do so.

*gcc g++ git libcurl4-openssl-dev curl coreutils bash wget gfortran
